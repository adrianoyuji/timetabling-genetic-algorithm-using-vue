# timetabling-genetic-algorithm-using-vue
I developed a solution for the timetabling problem using genetic algorithm. JavaScript and VueJS were used in order to develop this project. This genetic algorithm generates a random initial population, then proceeds to breed and create new individuals while evaluating their fitness score, those individuals have 10% chance of suffering a mutation. After 100 generations, an optimal solution for our timetabling problem is presented.
